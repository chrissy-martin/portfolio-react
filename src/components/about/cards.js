          Hello! My name is Chrissy Martin.
            <br />
            I am an animal care professional with a background in public speaking and psychology currently pursuing an intensive full stack certificate from the University of Washington. I am honing my skills in HTML5, CCS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, and a bit of Python and MySQL. I plan to create and maintain websites while also developing iOS and Android apps. I am able to collaborate and work with a team while solving problems in high-stress environments. I am looking to bring my attention to detail and technical skills to a company to grow and become a valuable asset. Iâ€™m excited to leverage my skills as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team.
